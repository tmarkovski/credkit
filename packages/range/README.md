# @credkit/range

CCS set-membership range proofs (Camenisch–Chaabouni–shelat, ASIACRYPT 2008) over BLS12-381.
Pure TypeScript on `@noble/curves`, same pairing toolkit as [`@credkit/bbs`](../bbs). No WASM.

**Status: implemented.** No spec and no fixtures exist for this layer; the design decisions
are recorded in [`docs/FINDINGS.md`](../../docs/FINDINGS.md) §6 and §12 and pinned by this
package's own golden-vector tests. **Read [`docs/BRIEF.md`](../../docs/BRIEF.md) first.**

## How it works

The verifier signs its digit alphabet once — Boneh–Boyen signatures `A_i = G1 * 1/(x+i)` for
`i in {0..base-1}` — publishes `y = G2 * x` and the `A_i`, and discards `x`. That is the whole
"trusted setup": a verifier that signs extra values only fools itself.

To prove a hidden value is in `[0, base^digits)`, the prover decomposes it into digits, blinds
one alphabet signature per digit (`V_i = A_{d_i} * v_i`, uniform in G1*), and runs a
Schnorr-style proof of the pairing relation `e(V_i, y) = e(V_i, G2)^(-d_i) * e(G1, G2)^(v_i)`
per digit — one pairing to prove, two (batched) to verify. Under u-Strong-DH, a digit outside
the signed alphabet would require a BB forgery.

What binds the digits to an actual value is the **aggregate response**
`Σ base^i * d^_i = (Σ base^i * d~_i) + c·value`: set the aggregate blinding to another
statement's Schnorr blinding for the same value, under ONE merged Fiat–Shamir challenge, and
the verifier checks a single linear relation between response scalars. That is why this
package has **no standalone verify and no internal challenge** — a range proof is meaningless
until it is tied to something. [`@credkit/proofs`](../proofs) does the tying (`RangePredicate`,
over hidden numeric BBS messages); use it unless you are building a new composite framework.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/params.ts` | Alphabet params: `createRangeParams`, `verifyRangeParams`, serialization. |
| `src/proof.ts` | `digitDecompose`, `aggregateDigitScalar`, and the three-phase sigma protocol: `rangeProofInit` / `rangeProofFinalize` / `rangeVerifyInit`. Wire format. |
| `test/range.test.ts` | Params, digit machinery, the protocol against a manual challenge, tampering, golden vectors. |

## Rules the API enforces (don't fight them)

- **`base^digits <= 2^64`, both sides.** This is soundness, not hygiene: one-sided range
  proofs reject a negative difference because it wraps to ~2^255 mod r and cannot decompose —
  which only holds while `base^digits` is far below r.
- **Identity `V_i` is rejected.** An identity V satisfies the digit relation for ANY digit
  with `v = 0`, voiding the alphabet bound.
- **Everything is mod r.** The natural >=/<= reading of a range claim requires the
  application to encode honest values well below r (e.g. dob as days since 1900).
- **Params are the verifier's own.** `verifyRangeParams` catches a malformed alphabet (run it
  on imported params); it cannot catch a verifier issuing per-prover alphabets as tracking
  tags. Fetch params from the same published location as everyone else.
